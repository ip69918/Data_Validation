# Data_Validation
  Data validation means checking the accuracy and quality of source data before using, importing or otherwise processing data. Data validation in Python is the process of ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. It involves verifying that data meets predefined criteria and rules to maintain its quality.Python offers numerous libraries and tools, such as Pandas, NumPy, and regular expressions, to automate data validation processes.
  But in our application you can validate the data easily. You need only a docker or a good internet connectivity.

## Features
- Validates CSV and JSON payloads. <br/>
- Provides API endpoints for validation. <br/>
- Dockerized for easy deployment.

You will get validation status.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.8+** installed. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Docker** installed (for containerized deployment). (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Any necessary Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

# Getting started
## Python Installation and Setup
If you are running the project locally without Docker, you need to install the required Python packages.
### a. Create a virtual environment 
- On Windows:
```bash  python -m venv env ```

### Activate the virtual environment:
